<b>Unhatched</b><br>
<br>
Last night you fell hunched over as again we set to roam.<br>
The moon a single puncture to this speckled eggshell dome.<br>
<br>
I cheered you with a nacre chip won early in my youth,<br>
And hushed the drum of steady pips that lost your eggshell tooth.<br>
<br>
You washed your wilted heels in tears to never grow your feathers.<br>
But though we failed to break through, dear, at least we failed together.<br>
