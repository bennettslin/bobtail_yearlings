<b>Look Back in Anger</b><br>
<br>
Scrambled past this hell, where flagboy last fell,<br>
dragging aglets held by the bastard's boot, <br>
as the Van Nuys belles lunched soundless through the noon. <br>
Now your sapling cut says you've past ring one, <br>
yet--if adding up--then for more you'd vie. <br>
From the valley of death you rode, so on spite you thrive. <br>
<br>
Feeble feeder fish allowed to grow; <br>
these spluttered fits found fit for show. <br>
You wished a cancer nibbled off, <br>
and laid down on the public trough. <br>
<br>
She braves the crowd filled first from sides. <br>
She might complete your jigsawed life. <br>
With hair of maraschino red, <br>
"Great show," she later said. <br>
<br>
Well there are ways to make a treat of life, <br>
and you were fine when you had none. <br>
But knowing now what you'd missed out on, you find, <br>
you look back in anger that it's done. <br>
<br>
When religious kids mocked, each hypocrite's taunts<br>
would just acquit God of further need; <br>
reading His obit not a bang, just a murmuring. <br>
Now each new concession sees this peasant<br>
discontented all the more, <br>
with his ignorance lessened of his plight before... <br>
<br>
Beyonders prevail, the letters preached, <br>
and thus secure, must turn the cheek. <br>
You waved your pledge to this godly good, <br>
only to crack, sprawled where they stood... <br>
<br>
Though, if you're right to want what's yours, <br>
weren't they right to take what's theirs? <br>
So if you're weeping for poor squirrels, <br>
also weep for poor, poor bears. <br>
<br>
Red and friends, lagging by the back door, <br>
lift you on angel stares. <br>
Drunk, you'd claim you've never loved, <br>
but it's too late to unscrew a Bud... <br>
<br>
Yes, you were wrong to make demands on life, <br>
'cause when you beg it never comes. <br>
And we all find this out on our own time... <br>
Look back in anger to have won.<br>
