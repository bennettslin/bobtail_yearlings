<b>My 100,000th Dream</b><br>
<br>
My hundred thousandth dream, I bumped into my Sita.<br>
Silent for a while, we searched our eyes, <br>
then we smiled and like old times, <br>
I took her shoulder as we drove from El Torito.<br>
I said never again we'll slave our whole lives away! <br>
<br>
As pretty as the rainbow, Sita! Sita! <br>
Did I ever live another life? <br>
As precious as a summer, Sita! Sita! <br>
Did I ever live another life? <br>
And were you mine? <br>
<br>
My hundred thousandth dream, I kissed my senorita, <br>
on the pampas where the gopis played, <br>
and the seasons glide away. <br>
I can't remember how or when my heart was Sita's. <br>
We were young, so sure of life, never knowing time unkind! <br>
<br>
I spent a lifetime waiting, Sita! Sita! <br>
Did I ever live another life? <br>
We blow the wind in whistles, Sita! Sita! <br>
Did I ever live another life? <br>
When you were mine? <br>
<br>
My hundred thousandth dream, on the cliffs of El Cerrito, <br>
she says now it's dark and getting late, <br>
but we'll always have today. <br>
Why does my last thought in this world belong to Sita? <br>
Now the light spills warm and bright... gently fills these eyes... <br>
<br>
She'll always come to take me, Sita! Sita! <br>
Will I ever live another life? <br>
Real or imaginary, Sita! Sita! <br>
Will I ever live another life? <br>
When you'll be mine? <br>
