<b>Dear Saskia</b><br>
<br>
Dearest Sasha,<br>
<br>
It's nearing autumn here with record highs.<br>
Is it searing in Boston? Hope this letter finds<br>
your first semester fine while I'm out of town...<br>
You'd love Taiwan, surrounded by walls of mountains,<br>
their peaks sealed and shielded by foggy clouds.<br>
Beneath this ceiling yields the scene a reeling feel<br>
of some giant's house.<br>
<br>
So... before I left, you said<br>
I should keep your kid name, with everything it meant.<br>
But then in your embrace, I felt you prepped to shed...<br>
<br>
And I'd reflect inside withering amber eyes--<br>
your pupil's pupal fly, a pet petrified--<br>
with you raving over how he's getting you<br>
staying kosher. Though, you know, I would have too...<br>
<br>
And I sniffled daily when you skipped a grade.<br>
One bus seat up you moved, letting rippled braids<br>
caress, sun-streaked and loose, a wet-cheeked papoose<br>
sadly weaned from you...<br>
<br>
Whom I knew I'd lose the day,<br>
you flew enraged and shooed them from their game;<br>
untied this "tetherboy", soothing in your lecture voice.<br>
Oh but Sasha, if anarchy reigns,<br>
then no one lives when narcing to the aides,<br>
who shrug when thus annoyed, yawning, "Boys will beat boys..."<br>
<br>
Well Sasha... okay, you saw the cuts.<br>
But though my jaw was stuck, so now I talk Canuck,<br>
there's been plenty days I've really been through worse.<br>
Anyway, I'm feeling healed. Still, hugging hurts...<br>
<br>
And Sasha, I know you'll have them all,<br>
while if I last the fall playing possum<br>
is a toss-up. But where some haemophile<br>
might bleed the Nile to nausea,<br>
I can wash up, and hope the bastards croak,<br>
on rat turds choked.<br>
