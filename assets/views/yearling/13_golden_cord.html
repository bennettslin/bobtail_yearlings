<b>On a Golden Cord</b><br>
<br>
<i>(about "doublespeaker rhyme": line in regular text<br>

<br>
On a golden cord, once worn, now shorn, <br>
safely kept with bread and pocket lint. <br>
Not of its own accord, but broken for what its promise meant. <br>
And so she said, "Now it's yours again... <br>
And how you look tonight! <br>
So polite, yet resigned, with wounds dressed and feelings put away. <br>
Full of patient replies... But how can I trust a word you say? <br>
So spill away.. and please, dear, you have no more secrets saved. <br>
I'm sorry, but I went through your mail today..." <br>
<br>
Immerse the moulted form in holy foggy night, <br>
<i>Returned a golden cord, this sole belonging signed.</i><br>
emerged beside a pauper's grave from dreams. <br>
<i>Leave early, time's up, cross your date released. </i><br>
The wraith surveys the widow on his pyre; <br>
<i>The jailer waves a bit, though uninspired, </i><br>
torched the bellyaches on suttee. <br>
<i>for the well-behaved on the wing. </i><br>
<br>
Had I grown dispirited in all this act, <br>
<i>As I soak in spirits amidst wanted ads--</i><br>
by disparate elements, like kindling gathered up? <br>
<i>my desperate ailments tied in this shambler's dusk--</i><br>
Guilt pardons the spectre taunting twin streetlamps; <br>
<i>still hardened against her fawning, misty glance, </i><br>
hatchet man who's burnt enough. <br>
<i>past this avenue Möbius. </i><br>
<br>
But a precious gift as a shedded chain, <br>
<i>But the present slips past a debt unpaid, </i><br>
has lain to rust, one more cruel memento. <br>
<i>that slays you once before you'll let it go. </i><br>
Then if life were real, not just drunken play...<br>
<i>And if night were peeled off the front of day...</i><br>
But what do I know?<br>
<i>But what do I know?</i><br>
<br>
Just that those playful pups with their hateful fangs<br>
knew the restraint of those born as hunters, <br>
while this supposed dove chafing in his cage, <br>
just learned he's pecked to death his precious other.<br>
But should it matter since you loved her once, <br>
when you really thought the world that simple? <br>
And who's to judge how much you cared because<br>
the gesture then was just a little more worth working for?... <br>
<i>Mush! Mush!</i> <br>
Now the jester teeters towards... <br>
<br>
the taunting, streetswept dawn. <br>
Thoughts spawned then dropped, of gathering up the suttee dust. <br>
Some things just come to loss: <br>
this bracelet, its lustre; me, my lust. <br>
Or was I once, something not what I've become? <br>
Have I just killed the thing I love? <br>
<br>
Of fateful thoughts hung on a gilded clasp, <br>
<i>Once navels locked upon the wilted grass,</i><br>
which this Ubermensch reavowed he'd come to snip. <br>
<i>digging through her innie, the outie snug-to-fit. </i><br>
And a smarting head throbs once his brain's warring halves, <br>
<i>Then the guardian knot of this frayed cord detached, </i><br>
each attack with the proper fist. <br>
<i>leaked the bandage upon her wrist. </i><br>
<br>
A sober plea finds the present you, <br>
<i>The former me might have left a clue</i><br>
my alias drunk, in panic and starved for leads. <br>
<i>by trail of crumbs, which vanished as bartered feed. </i><br>
And will she label lies oaths we vowed we could, <br>
<i>Until we strangle cries knowing how we stood, </i><br>
with Garry's sole witness relieved?<br>
<i>when buried whole with the deceased. </i><br>
<br>
So a plan devised divides a slave once wed; <br>
<i>Though, the master mind reminds us, straight ahead, </i><br>
a bid for greatness' sake, he's sold on as holy war. <br>
<i>a bigger plate awaiting nulls one half full before.</i><br>
When longed by nothing you then fight the best, <br>
<i>And fond sighs of reunion I must rest; </i><br>
for kohl-eyed houris as reward. <br>
<i>forego like jewelry that she wore. </i><br>
